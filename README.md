Market Research Analyzer
1. Problem Statement
Organizations face challenges in keeping up with rapidly changing market data scattered across reports, PDFs, and websites. Analysts spend extensive time manually extracting insights. There is a need for an AI system capable of summarizing, comparing, and answering questions about market trends automatically.

2. Objective
The goal is to build an AI-powered Market Research Analyzer that:

Ingests diverse market reports including PDFs, CSVs, and web data.

Supports natural language queries on competitors, industries, and trends.

Delivers real-time summaries and cross-source comparisons.

3. Proposed Solution
Utilizing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach with:

LangChain for orchestrating workflows and retrieval chains.

Pinecone as the semantic vector search database to index market data.

Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) for language understanding, summarization, and insight generation.
